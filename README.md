# Word File Generator using PySimpleGUI and docxtpl

## Description
This Python script allows you to generate Word documents using a template provided in the `template.docx` file. The user is prompted to input various details such as project name, location, population, area, latitude, longitude, and more. The script uses the `PySimpleGUI` library for creating the user interface and the `docxtpl` library for rendering the template and generating the Word document.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
3. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
4. Place the `template.docx` file in the same directory as the script.
5. Run the script `word-editor.py`.
6. Follow the prompts in the GUI window to input the necessary details.
7. Click the "Create File" button to generate the Word document.
8. The generated Word document will be saved in the same directory with the specified filename.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by the need to automate the generation of Word documents based on a template for creating a number of reports on pre-feasibility study of Irrigation projects that I did at Kaligandaki River Basin in Nepal.

## Note
The script uses the `template.docx` file as the base template for generating the Word document. Make sure to customize the template according to your needs before running the script. Also, the .exe file has a bug yet to be solved.
